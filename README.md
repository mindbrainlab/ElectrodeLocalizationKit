# ELK: Electrode Localization Kit

![Program Logo](src/ui/qt_designer/images/MainLogo.png)

## Overview

Accurate localization of EEG scalp electrodes is crucial for precisely estimating the underlying neuronal activity from observed electrical potential changes on the scalp. Various techniques for electrode localization have been proposed, categorized into direct measurements on the subject's head or indirect methods utilizing structural MRI scans. Most direct measurement methods are expensive as they rely on complex stereo vision systems or are magnetic-field-driven, making them especially inconvenient for experiments involving simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisition and cannot be used in the vicinity of the MRI scanner. Indirect methods are susceptible to artifacts, particularly with high-density EEG caps, where dense wire bundles cause signal dropouts on MR images.

To address these challenges, we present an open-source Python environment for electrode localization. Our approach utilizes surface models of the human head generated from data acquired by affordable IR stereo structured light projection cameras and/or structural MRI head scans. Our primary objective was to streamline the electrode localization process, reducing both acquisition and processing time. We achieved automated electrode detection from head texture images and electrode labeling from template location files, reducing the acquisition and processing time together to under 5 minutes. Our environment enhances efficiency and accuracy in EEG electrode localization, facilitating seamless integration into neuroimaging workflows.

## Key Features

- **Affordable IR Stereo Structured Light Projection Cameras**: Utilizes cost-effective equipment for generating surface models.
- **Structural MRI Head Scans**: Compatible with MRI scans to improve localization accuracy.
- **Automated Electrode Detection and Labeling**: Reduces acquisition and processing time to under 5 minutes.
- **Open-Source**: Freely available Python package to streamline electrode localization.

## Installation

**Note:** This package requires **Python 3.11**.

To install the required dependencies for ELK, we recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), an extremely fast Python package and project manager written in Rust. While users can choose their preferred tool, we suggest and support `uv` for its speed and reliability.

First, install `uv`:

```sh
# Using curl
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Or using pip
pip install uv
```

## Running the App

Once `uv` is installed, navigate to the project's root directory and run:
## Running the App

Once `uv` is installed, navigate to the project's root directory and run:

```sh
uv run src/main.py
uv run src/main.py
```

On the first run, this command creates a virtual environment, installs all dependencies, and starts the app. This may take a moment but only happens the first time.

## Supported Formats

The package currently supports:

- **.ced** manufacturer's electrode locations
- FreeSurfer head surface files generated with the **BEM** flag (e.g., `recon-all -s <subject> -all -make` and `mne watershed_bem -s <subject>`)

The package was tested on structural scans acquired using the Structure Sensor on an Apple iPad and iTSeez3D software.

# Developers

## Code Formatting

The codebase is formatted using **[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)**, an extremely fast Python linter and code formatter written in Rust. Ruff ensures your code maintains a consistent style by automatically formatting it to be as readable and maintainable as possible.

### Installation

To format your code using Ruff, we recommend installing it with `uv`:

```sh
uv add --dev ruff
```

After installation, format your code with:

```sh
ruff format .
```

Alternatively, if you prefer using `pip`, you can install Ruff with:

```sh
pip install ruff
ruff format .
```

For more configuration options and detailed usage, refer to the [Ruff documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/).

### Integrating Ruff with Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

To enhance your development experience, integrate Ruff directly into VSCode:

1. **Install the Ruff Extension**:

   - Open VSCode and navigate to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
   - Search for "Ruff" and install the extension named "Ruff" by Charlie Marsh.

2. **Configure the Extension**:

   After installation, the extension should automatically detect your project's `pyproject.toml` configuration. To ensure proper integration:

   - Open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` and select "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)".
   - Add or update the following settings to enable formatting and import organization on save:

     ```json
     {
       "[python]": {
         "editor.formatOnSave": true,
         "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
           "source.organizeImports.ruff": true,
           "source.fixAll.ruff": true
         }
       }
     }
     ```

   This configuration enables automatic formatting and import sorting each time you save a Python file.

For more configuration options and detailed usage, refer to the [Ruff documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/).

## Versioning

We are using **Semantic Versioning** for this project. For details, see [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Git Workflow

We follow the **[Gitflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)** workflow. This means our development process includes feature branches, release branches, and hotfix branches. Here's a basic overview:

1. **Feature Branches**: All new features should be developed in dedicated branches created from the `develop` branch. Name these branches clearly, e.g., `feature/awesome-new-feature`.

2. **Release Branches**: When it's time to prepare a new release, create a branch from `develop` named `release/x.x.x`.

3. **Hotfix Branches**: For urgent fixes that need to go into production immediately, create a branch from `main` named `hotfix/x.x.x`.

4. **Merging**: Feature branches are merged back into `develop`. Release branches are merged into both `main` and `develop`. Hotfix branches are merged into both `main` and `develop`.

### Commit Messages
