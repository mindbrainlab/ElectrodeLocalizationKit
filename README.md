# pyLocalizer

The pyLocalizer toolbox, a Python-based solution, is designed for precise EEG
electrode localization on both IR-camera-generated head surfaces and MRI
surfaces. This versatile tool features a user-friendly graphical interface,
streamlining the localization process for researchers. Efficiently localize
EEG electrode positions on various surfaces, enhancing the accuracy and
reliability of data collection and analysis in neuroimaging studies.
